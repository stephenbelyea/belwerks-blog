I’d been on it since 2011 and had built a decent-sized community of web developers, accessibility advocates, political progressives, and a healthy mix of friends and previous co-workers. Conferences and professional events were fun, as it made for a nice list of new follows and let me reach out to celebrate peoples’ work when I was much, much too nervous to speak with them in person.</p>\n<p>Like many other things in life, the taint of Trump, wafting up from down South, made Twitter utterly unbearable. Mind you, the platform has been a hive of scum and villainy for years prior - but MAGA really opened the floodgates of people believing (correctly, as it would mostly seem) that they’d no longer be judged for their awful, bigoted views.</p>\n<p>2016-2018 was a bad stretch for doom scrolling. It impacted my family life, my sleep, my level of irritation and radicalization — really, it was just generally awful all around. So, I left. I deleted my Twitter account and ditched all the community I had been building for years. I also deleted Instagram and locked down privacy and sharing on Facebook.</p>\n<p>Flash forward to mid 2020, and I’m tuning in for <a href=\"https://inclusivedesign24.org/2020/\">#ID24, the annual free online inclusive design conference</a>. Every single speaker would put up their Twitter handle at the end of a talk and nudge the conversation into that sphere. For the first major time since leaving, I really, really missed the positives of Twitter.</p>\n<p>So, reluctantly, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306425902788685825\">I signed back up</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306426619712679938\">regained my old @belwerks handle</a> pretty easily. I immediately started following and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306739938868817920\">engaging with everyone in attendance or speaking</a> at the conference. Many of them were people I’d previously followed and/or interacted with on the platform. It was nice.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 657px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 63.67521367521368%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/a85df/first-tweet.webp 234w,\n/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/2cd4d/first-tweet.webp 468w,\n/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/1728a/first-tweet.webp 657w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/25b21/first-tweet.png 234w,\n/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/6ff8b/first-tweet.png 468w,\n/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/92e7a/first-tweet.png 657w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/2af67181b7a8c2d5d4b1ca9a5264b897/92e7a/first-tweet.png\"\n            alt=\"tweet from belwerks reads &quot;I&#39;m back.

I won’t follow companies, political figures, celebrities, or really any other avenues of blatant marketing and promotion. I will also never log into Twitter on my phone again. Or laptop. It stays on my iMac desktop, where I have to go to my study and fire it up on purpose. Same with Facebook.</p>\n<p>I quickly built up a nice, positive feed of accessibility advocates and inclusive designers. Coincidentally, this also wound up with a progressive-minded feed, as far as political opinions go. Funny how that works, eh? It’s almost like compassion and empathy correlates with a particular side of the political spectrum…</p>\n<p>It’s still impossible to avoid politics altogether - as I care deeply about human progress, equality, and justice, as well as investigative and ethical journalism. I still have doom scrolling moments - especially <a href=\"https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1346927367651008516\">during the recent insurrection attempt</a> - but it’s easier to step away when it isn’t on my phone or any other portable device. I recommend the same for everyone else.</p>\n<p>In light of all this, you might notice a Twitter icon in my social links and a “keep the discussion going” shout-out at the bottom of every post now. I likely won’t respond right away (or at all, if you’re a dick about it), but I’m hoping it’s a good way to keep up the positive, communal aspects of this often-heinous platform.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Should I stay or should I go?","date":"January 27, 2021","description":"A couple of years back, I quit Twitter.
