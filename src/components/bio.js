      <h2>I'm Stephen Belyea</h2>
      <p>
        I am a front end developer with a heavy focus on accessibility,
        performance, and user interaction for any device or screen size. I like
        crafting experiences that anyone can use and I'll put in the effort to
        make sure they're able to do so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        A developer since 2012, I started in a LAMP stack, with a primary focus
        on WordPress. After some time in .NET, AngularJS, and early experience
        with TypeScript, I've settled into a modern JavaScript framework world.
        Most of my time has been in React, with projects in Angular and Vue to
        round out the framework trio. Jumping into new tech is a great way to
        learn and discover all the best and less-best parts of everything.
